  The Pyscript Bundle is my take on a bundled suite of Python Scripts for solving various numerical mathematical problems I should come across in my studies.<br><br>
  The bundle did not end up being nearly as useful as I had first hoped, as the class was not nearly as deep as I first expected it to be, but more of an introductory class. Nevertheless, the scripts will see use some day, and on that day shall I return to improve this project manyfold (which isn't hard because it is quite barebones at the time of writing this..)<br><br>
