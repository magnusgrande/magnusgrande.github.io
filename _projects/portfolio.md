  If you see this page, it means I at least managed to get this thing up and running :)<br><br>

  This E-Portfolio is a project running alongside the other projects in the class Team-based collaboration (IDATA1004), but is primarily intended as a kickstart to a personal portfolio that will follow us through both our academic and our professional careers.<br><br>
  
  Much like a resum√©, I doubt this will ever be truly finished. The plan is to keep it updated with new projects and experiences as I go along. I also hope to keep it updated with new features and improvements as I learn more about web development and design.<br><br>

  The portfolio is built using Jekyll, a static site generator, and is hosted on GitHub Pages. The template used is called WhatATheme, was created and shared by TheDevsLot, and can be found linked at the bottom of any page on the site.<br><br>

  Notable changes from the original template include:
    <li>Project pages for each individual project, custom made to suit my needs, with the current status of the project on the left, and a longer description on the right.</li>
    <li>A simplified front page, devoid of blog posts and links to social medias that I have never even used.</li>
    <li>Some surprisingly fancy progress bars to show how far along I am in my studies.</li>
  <br>
  My future plans for the site include:
    <li>Adding a page dedicated page for crediting the sources of what few images I have used.</li>
    <li>Implementing a more in-depth 'About Me'-page.</li>
    <li>Creating a separate page for Skills and Certifications.</li>
