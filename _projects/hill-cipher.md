  <b>Intro</b><br>  
  The Hill Cipher project was the first of two projects we were given in Mathematics for Engineers (IMAA1002) during our first semester as computer science students at NTNU. The project was aimed at teaching us the basics of encryption and decryption, and how to apply these concepts in a real-world scenario.<br><br>
  
  The project was handed to us in September of 2024, and was due in early October. This was also the first project where we were given the freedom to choose our own groups, although our group ended up being near identical to the pre-determined one we had in another class.<br><br>
  
  Our assignment first had us explain a Hill Cipher in detail, and then had us use the cipher to encrypt, and then decrypt a 4-letter word using a 4x4 key matrix and the linear algebra we had learned at that point of the curriculum.<br><br>
