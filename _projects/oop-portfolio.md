long-description: >
    This portfolio is a collection of Java projects I have worked on during the course IDATA1003 - Object-Oriented Programming at NTNU. The projects are all written in Java, and are intended to showcase my understanding of object-oriented programming.<br><br>
    
    The first, and only project in the portfolio so far is a command-line application built to track a user's groceries, focusing on keeping an eye on expiry dates in an effort to reduce food waste.<br><br>
