long-description: >
  The Lego project is a group project with the goals of teaching us how to use good coding practices in a team (using GitLab for version control), implementing lean and other agile processes such as Scrum, and learning what makes a good group tick.<br><br>

  The project is very much a learning process, and projects in other subjects will help guide us on our way.<br><br>

  While we were formed as a pre-determined group at the start of the year, ours has suffered a slight setback in recent weeks as one group member has had their application to have former education count towards this degree, and as a result no longer has to take this particular subject.<br><br>
  Nevertheless we're motivated to get a good process going, and to make an end product we can be proud of as a group.<br><br>

  The process so far:<br>
    <li>We've had our first Scrum meeting with a student assistant. We had not had the time to plan this properly, and are aiming to improve manyfold by the next one, which has yet to be planned.</li>
    <li>We have decided as a group on our approach to the robot itself, and how it's unwise for us to plan for solving every problem on the board.
        <li>We would much rather make a robot with clever solutions to a few problems, than a robot that can, technically, solve all of them, though none of them well enough by our standards.</li>
    </li>
  <br><br>

  The process has since been interrupted by another project, Computer Architecture, in the same subject. As this project is now finalized we are shifting focus back over to our beloved Robot, where the actual process can finally begin.<br><br>

  Future plans for the process and project as a whole include:<br>
    <li>Making meaningful progress on the project.
    <li>Learning more about how to conduct good Scrum Retrospectives.
      <ul>
        <li>Finding a balance between the time spent on the retrospective and the time spent on the actual project will be key.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Naming our robot.
      <ul>
        <li>Every good robot has a name.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Setting clearer boundaries and expectations for the group, so as to avoid issues like the ones we faced in the Computer Architecture project.</li>
    <li>Setting up a proper GitLab repository for the project.</li>
    <li>Building a somewhat ambitious internal coordinate system for the robot to navigate its way around the board with.</li>
