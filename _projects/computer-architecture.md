  <b>Intro</b><br>
  Knowing how computers work is a fundamental skill for any computer science student. This project is handed to first-semester engineers at NTNU as an introduction to the inner workings of a computer.<br><br>
  
  Unlike the Lego project, this project is rather more straight-forward. The class is given three 4-hour lectures on Computer Architecture, and then handed a relevant subject to delve deeper into, write a report on and present in video-form to the teacher.<br><br>


  <b>Process & Role</b><br>
  Our group was handed the topic "Java Virtual Machine (JVM)", and did a deep dive into the inner workings of the programming language we're conveniently learning in another class.<br>
  The project was completed in October of 2024, with a 17-minute video presentation on our subject, going into detail on the following key parts of the JVM:
    <li>JVM's role in modern technology</li>
    <li>Usage and platform independency</li>
    <li>Pros and cons</li>
    <li>Architecture</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Performance</li>
    <li>Garbage collection</li>
    <li>Just-in-time compilation</li>
  <br>
  My tasks included writing and recording the parts for "JVM's role in modern technology" and "Just-in-time compilation", as well as writing the majority of the report.<br><br>

  <b>Future</b><br>
  Being handed the subject of JVM felt lucky. Learning how the virtual machine is built will be directly useful for our future studies, seeing as we're learning Java, and will be focusing on efficient code in the coming years.<br>
